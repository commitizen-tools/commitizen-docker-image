This repo checks daily for the latest version and tries to publish it.

## Migrating from `v2` to `v3` image

We've moved this images from using `CMD` to `ENTRYPOINT` for `v3`.

Where you were doing this:

```sh
docker run --rm --name commitizen registry.hub.docker.com/commitizen/commitizen:2 /bin/sh -c "cz ls"
```

Now you only need to do:

```sh
docker run --rm --name commitizen registry.hub.docker.com/commitizen/commitizen:3 ls
```

## Usage

## As Script

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  commitizen/commitizen:latest \
  bump --changelog
```

## Inside container

Open a terminal inside docker with `cz` available and with the current directory mounted.
This way we can run any `cz` command.

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --entrypoint /bin/sh \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  commitizen/commitizen:latest
```
